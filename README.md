## Task Done:
The pages that I have done are, ***The main page, The art page, and The Our Society page*** in the about menu.

## Anecdote:
The project though was quite enjoyable to do. I learnt some new things out of it, like figuring out, how to make that slideshow thing on the main page, or the photo collage in the art page, which i started doing row wise image arrangement, then realised, it actually is just a column wise image arrangement. I learnt many things from this project, and would like to thank you for such an amazing project.


>I have fever from about 7 days by now, so I just did what I can.
I was bedridden, but whenever,  I was feeling not so ill, I tried to work on the project, so please forgive me for the discrepancies in the project.
I did not get enough time to make stuff responsive, though I tried my best.
